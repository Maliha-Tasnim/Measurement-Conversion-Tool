Primary measure parameters are as below:
  1) Length & Distance
  2) Area
  3) Volume & Capacity
  4) Mass & Weight
  5) Speed
  6) Temparature
  
Different units are used to denote the quantity of these parameters. Such as kilograms & grams are used to denote mass & weight, meters & kilometers are used to denote length & distance and so on. The purpose of this project is to convert a particular unit of a parameter to another unit (e.g. gram to kilogram). User selects the parameter at first for conversion, then enter a quantity with a unit and also indicates the unit for final conversion. The program then returns the converted quantity for that unit.
